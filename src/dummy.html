<!--
     Web semantic refers to how a web application is laid out and what descriptors are used as selectors.
     This can include the tags, such as script, header, footer, etc, but can also refer to emphasis and bold
     in the context in line modifications. The purpose of using semantic language is for higher depth and
     description in the internet. Not only is it easier for people to understand your code when you have
     it listed out in proper semantic form, but it also makes pages easier to read for search crawlers to 
     scan through your website. This can increase SEO, which helps your page get maximum exposure to the
     target audience. Best practice is to use descriptive identifiers for each part of your code to make
     each piece relatable to the content that is going to be displayed therein. Even if you are using 
     <div>, you can still add descriptive classes or classNames. If you're going to create a website, you
    want to get the maximum exposure to your audience, and doing this will assist that process while making
    search easier for web parsing technology.
    Custom elements also can be defined and imported that are able to be used as descriptive tags of what is
    going to be displayed on your web site.

    Doctypes are an indicator to the browser that is reading your web application of what kind of document and
    elements are going to be displayed. It prepares the browser for what will be supported natively, if there
    are any considerations to take in before rendering an element, and what format to bring in the markup in.
    The version of html that is going to be used is also listed. Backwards compatability is the largest 
    modern concern of the DOCTYPE indicator.
